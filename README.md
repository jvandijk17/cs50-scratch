# CS50 Quest

Project Title: CS50 Quest

# Third-Party Library Usage:
I have used a third party library, created by Will_Wam, to print text on the scratch screen. Needing more styles than the Say block offered to create a more immersive experience, and limited time due to a full-time job as a programmer, I decided to use the library instead of building a text engine from scratch. However, all the logic written around the game was fully coded by me.

# About the Code
All the code related to the Will_Wam text engine is inside the sprite named "TextEngine", all the logic present in the other sprites are 100% developed by me.
